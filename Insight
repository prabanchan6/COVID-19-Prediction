This study used few supervised machine learning models to predict COVID 19 with the help of laboratory test results. The dataset involved pre-processing as 
there were many missing data values. The features with more than 85% missing values were dropped from the dataset which resulted in dimensionality reduction.
ExtraTreesClassifier is the feature extraction technique used in this study to extract the import features before training the classifier models used in this study. All the
classifier models had good accuracy, and cross validation score in predicting COVID 19. Logistic Regression, SVC, and KNN were the highly efficient models with an accuracy,
cross validation score of 91%, 90% respectively. The future work of this study can be done on a more balanced data to evaluate these classifier models as the precision,
recall score were not applicable due to imbalance of the dataset.
